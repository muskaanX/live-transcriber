**[12:35:41]** tell me when it's on the green button that's your start ok?  tell me when it's on the green button that's your start

**[12:35:51]** I said green button.

**[12:35:59]** Please, please, please, please.  What is this, guys?

**[12:36:01]** The mic is here.

**[12:36:42]** Is it detecting something right now?

**[12:36:46]** Yep, that's working.

**[12:37:09]** I don't know if that's right or not.

**[12:37:19]** It's just a bit...

**[12:39:34]** Thank you for joining me.

**[12:39:40]** These are S1s, all the S1s.

**[12:39:42]** No, it's not.

**[12:39:44]** It's all in the camera.

**[12:39:58]** What is this?  Are they human beings?  Are they human beings?  Are they human beings?  Are they humans?

**[12:40:02]** What do you need for this?

**[12:40:07]** I don't even know what I'm talking about.

**[12:40:16]** Thank you very much.

**[12:40:26]** You do that, you do that, you do that.

**[12:42:08]** Thank you.

**[12:42:11]** I don't think that goes very well.

**[12:43:07]** Can we take one?

**[12:43:19]** Thank you very much.

**[12:43:24]** Thank you guys for being with us together.

**[12:43:37]** I'm so sorry.  Let me have some.  Please.

**[12:43:53]** Thank you.

**[12:44:10]** Bye.

**[12:44:14]** Thank you.

**[12:44:17]** Thank you.

**[12:44:33]** Yeah, I can hear it.

**[12:44:37]** Thank you very much.

**[12:45:11]** No, no, no, no!

**[12:45:14]** I don't know what to say about this.  If you can't get out of here, that's a deal.  I don't need you there.  Please.  But I'm telling you, please.  I don't need you there.  Please.

**[12:46:46]** Thank you very much.

**[12:46:54]** Thank you very much.

**[12:49:24]** Thank you.

**[12:49:31]** Thank you very much.

**[12:49:33]** Thank you very much.

**[12:52:15]** Thank you.

**[12:52:22]** I

**[12:52:46]** Uh, I've been like...

**[12:52:53]** Okay, do you have a camera?

**[12:52:57]** Thank you.

**[12:53:17]** Yeah.

**[12:53:23]** Yeah.

**[12:53:43]** Thank you very much.

**[12:53:48]** Thank you very much.

**[12:54:27]** And I guess we need to do all of it.  I mean, you guys are in the middle of a pretty busy hackathon.  So I won't take too much of your time.  I won't, of course, look what I've done to anything  just to understand what you guys want out of the session  and what you guys are thinking about.  We don't know if you're hacking the video right now.  So if I could just ask, how many of you  want to start something like something?  Let me start up with you.

**[12:54:30]** And then how many of you want to join us?

**[12:54:41]** Okay, how are we going to cooperate and who has no idea what you want to do?

**[12:57:45]** So the reason why I ask is, it's helpful for me to know how you guys are at, and I know  you guys might be across, especially me at the senior year.  So the main point of this session is for me to kind of share a little bit more about the  entrepreneurship journey.  How you guys can leverage hackathon and stuff like that to prepare yourself for what  you'll be next.  And then spend more time talking about if I was in your shoes seeing all the  stuff that's happening with AI and stuff like that, how would I leverage my time  in college, and then kind of share some insights and what I would think is most  important for you guys to be optimizing for while you're in college, and then just  open up the floor to understand what you guys have as a question for helping.  So I'll just start with telling you a little bit about myself.  Born and raised in Delhi, I went to Sriram School in Maltzary.  In Sriram, I had two ventures.  I started an electric battery company, and then I also ran an NGO Fighting League.  After that, I did my undergrad in master's at Stanford,  post that I worked under Ajay Banga at MasterCard, who is the CEO of MasterCard.  We launched UPI in Agar Media.  After that, we launched our first company called Alope, which is a FinTech  company in the US.  We partnered with JP Morgan and scaled that up over three years.  Silicon Valley Bank went further, not very much in our control because of that,  we were forced to close our first company.  And then after that, chat GPT2 launched.  And that's when it felt very obvious for us to spend more time working in the AI  space and building some tech there.  So that's the phase where I didn't know what the hell I'm doing.  But we just started building random solutions for companies like Google and  a couple of other younger companies that then anthropic people that know  about we were building solutions with them.  Spent a year doing that, and then we had an insight that people were building a lot  of chat GPT rappers at that time and felt like services is going to be a big  disruption.  So we started building passion free to do stuff for $50 billion market,  which is agency services and marketing.  So that's when passion is born, which basically does autonomous marketing for  LLMs and SEO and then they're spending with ads and social media and stuff  like that this year.  And just to give you an idea of where we're at today, we're at a team of about 120 people.  And we currently just raised money from Microsoft Ventures Excel and Google Ventures.  And our goal is to basically replace the marketing system that a lot of  humans are involved in and completely like that autonomous, right?  So that's a little bit about us.  And what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you

**[12:58:08]** to start with is maybe the first step  which some of you might be focusing on.  Might be a bit late  because you guys always have building ideas.  But the first thing I wanted to discover  was how do you find an idea you want to work on.  And I think the first thing I wanted to cover was,  so in my chat, GPP came about,  everybody starts building the most obvious thing.  So if you, I don't know if you were tracking  what technologies came up,  but there's a company called Jasper  that came up and became very, very popular.  Jasper was like the most obvious solution  from GPP.

**[12:58:40]** So what they built was basically a content writer using chat sheet.  They scaled to about $100 million in revenue in the first six months.  And then what Jasper built became so not worth it  that they built a crazy product in the first six months,  which was the most obvious use case.  But then today, they're struggling to scale,  and nobody really talks about Jasper or uses Jasper  because it was the most obvious application I've ever  learned because there were 100 other competitors that came out.  But they don't exist today.  We don't talk about them anymore in the section.

**[12:58:49]** So, the first thing we're finding ideas is not going after the train.  It's about finding something that's the not normal use case that is contrary to what people think.

**[12:58:57]** So Uber and Lyft are really good examples of companies that did this really really well.  So their insight was when…

**[12:59:16]** Smartphones so I kind of love the first technology that was important for the smartphone was they had a GPS in your phone  Right and the most obvious use cases people were thinking about building maps and before Google Maps came about there were 10,000 other  Companies trying to build maps for local local use cases that I could use in that

**[12:59:21]** But what they thought was, well, if I can have somebody  be able to tell their location on their phone.

**[13:00:03]** a phone with GPS with internet leads to a rideway, right?  And that's a non-contradient thesis  that people thought about and then built against.  And that was the company that created the $100 billion, right?  So similarly with AI, when chat GPT launched,  the most obvious use case was when  you build a wrapper on top of GPT,  which everybody was building in a generation,  copywriting, et cetera.  And what you all used to do GPT for as well,  completing your homework assignments and writing essays.  What we thought in that time was very,  like what we thought was not obvious,  which people think is obvious today, is agent.

**[13:00:32]** So if we're all spending a lot of our time doing human work,  how do you replace the human in the gym?  So that's what we focused on.  And that time a lot of people did not want to invest in us.  A lot of people didn't think there was a big market  for us to be this young.  But that's where today it feels like a much larger space  to be and I will be talking about it.  But that's when you think right when you've been  talking about something for two years,  then people hear that you were the first person  I was thinking about this,  let me back to you because you have a really good

**[13:01:10]** So, to kind of put this together, generally the most important ideas are the ones that are unsexy.  There are spaces that I'd suggest you guys to think about like construction, like legal, like accounting,  and try to build in spaces like that, and industries that have bigger budgets.  So, copywriting, not a lot of people write content, it's a very small space,  but a lot of people are doing construction, your new building is a massive investment that is so coming.  Those are industries that are massive in opportunity and will be disruptive for us to react.  And that's where we have a bigger city.

**[13:01:15]** The second piece I want to cover was the idea framework, right?

**[13:01:29]** How do you think about, I have a bunch of ideas  and everything problems, things I can solve for,  what do I choose to spend my time solving, right?  So, I think first is, I think a lot of people think that...

**[13:01:46]** you have to have expertise to solve something.  So you guys will probably think that I have to go get a job,  learn a lot about XYZ industry and then go and solve this.  But it's interesting just because in the VC space  investors are looking to back companies  where founders actually have no expertise in the space.

**[13:01:58]** The reason behind this is people are trying to rethink  how particular verticals are running,  and then looking for young people  that are coming up with a very new application for this.

**[13:02:10]** So for example, OpenAI is born from somebody who has been building in deep research and  model training and neural networks training for years.

**[13:02:26]** Anthropic, which is the previous competitor,  had a completely different thing on how  to go about doing this instead without any expertise  in building co-foundational models.  And today, they are one of the most successful  competitors to open up a strategy to do this.

**[13:02:51]** So similarly, Harvey is a very big company that came up  that tried to rewrite legal, like basically  how the legal system works and how legal firms work.  He had zero expertise in how he's not allowed to do that.  But he rethought how the full model works from scratch  and they're doing over about $300 million  for the last 10 years.

**[13:04:20]** So what this is looking out for is not experience in the field,  so that should not be limiting factor,  but just a new take on how you disrupt the field.  So I'd push you to do that.  But the questions I think people are trying to ask  with AI today, which is obviously the biggest inflection  that's happening is,  which industry is stuck the most in the middle ages?  So what are the things that you guys maybe do  or you guys hear your parents,  you guys hear your friends that are just gradually to do,  that is stuck the most in the middle ages  and you think has the biggest scope for innovation.  The most obvious ones of Google and stuff  are already developing on,  we will win for sure in that market.  But the most non-obvious ones,  the ones that are most stuck in the middle ages  will have the biggest impact.  And over here is where we come back to  finding unsexy things  and most people in college and we try to gravitate  with problems you guys face in college.  But guys, the problems you guys face in college  are probably the smallest problems you can tackle.  They are not the biggest problems  that actually people in the world face.  So talk to your parents more so in terms of  by what are you facing a problem with  that helps you actually get a better perspective  of what you guys can solve for.

**[13:04:22]** And I think the last thing is, before you decide what idea you're going to solve for, try to get something to pay something to solve for it.

**[13:04:49]** 100 people will tell you, I'm okay with working on something.  Or yeah, I'd like this extra feature,  or I'd like this extra thing.  But unless somebody seems like I'm actually trying  to spend money to solve this problem,  it's really not a problem worth solving for.  If I can ask anybody what they're currently working on,  is that something that we can share?  Yeah.  If there's something you guys are building  for the hackathon or generally, yeah, please.

**[13:05:00]** Okay.

**[13:05:03]** 3, 2, 1.

**[13:05:56]** Thank you very much.

**[13:06:05]** Interesting. So my question here is, if you would evaluate your idea.

**[13:06:12]** How many scouts do you think exist in India across all the football clubs?

**[13:06:49]** And how much is it in ice and springs on the scouts?

**[13:06:54]** So, the reason why I ask this question is...

**[13:07:03]** like very real problem statements, something that you are actually passionate about and  something that makes sense, right? And it makes sense to most of us.

**[13:07:16]** The problem that generally startups don't fail because they didn't build a good product.  They actually fail because they didn't pick a big enough problem.  That's a big enough need.

**[13:07:26]** It's actually one of the sponsors for this AMD.  They bought a company for $2 billion  from this Indian guy called Perinja.  He's built five companies worth $15 billion.

**[13:07:44]** The first company he built, in 1983, raised $80 million from Sikora.  That's more than $700 million in today's market.  And they built the first video voice integrated solution that exists on your laptop.

**[13:07:58]** really cool idea, really cool product. But there was no, the product was literally just  too good, but way ahead of its time, because of which nobody bought the software in 2  years, they were out.

**[13:08:07]** So when we think about what problem to solve, there are a thousand problems that are exciting  and this is actually what matter.

**[13:08:16]** What's most important to answer is how big is this a pain point for the person that I'll sell it to.  So I think you'll sell it to ISL Scouts.

**[13:08:23]** ISIL Scouts probably get paid about 10 to 30 lakhs a year.

**[13:08:31]** If I have to multiply that 10 lakhs by 16 that is 1.6 crore so they spend on scouts.

**[13:08:40]** you're probably going to replace 50% of those scouts, right?  So your market automatically is about 50 to 70 lakhs a year.

**[13:09:16]** Now, if I have to build CCTV footage for replacing 50, 60  lakhs a year, there's a lot of tech  to be able to build to track so many players across so many  different turfs they might be playing at,  to just drive a delta for somebody at 50, 60 lakhs.  Now, if you apply that same thing for error detection  in manufacturing, right?  Manufacturing has even a 2% to 4% defect rate  is a massive problem statement to solve.  With the very same tech you can build,  which actually might be slightly easier than detecting  how people move, right?

**[13:09:18]** that is over 500 billion dollar problem in the world today.

**[13:09:47]** So, your same tech could be applied in a very different scenario.  I'm not saying you should not try to bring this out,  but it's about how you think about sizing the market,  not just what you're passionate about.  To be honest, I was not born thinking,  I think Digital Marketing Agency is a passion of mine,  but it's just a massive opportunity  that convinces me every day  that I can make a massive impact, right?  One of my friends who sold his company  for $15 million a day before yesterday.

**[13:10:39]** and he does patent detection.  So suppose you run a company and you build a lot of tech,  all he does is goes through patents that exist out there  to help you understand how much,  how many patents can you counter sue for and make money.  So universities like Ashoka, Stanford pay a lot of money  because they generate over 50, 60 million dollars  by suing people for using technically knowledge  they created that's associated with patents they find.  Now in two years he sold it coming for 150 million.  He was not born interested in patents,  neither did he graduate from college  being interested in patents.  But he just saw a problem that was large enough,  build tech that was ready for it and sold it for 150 million.  So that's what I meant by idea frameworks  where a lot of things are interesting  and people tend to follow your passion.  I don't mean following your passion  is actually interesting.

**[13:10:55]** following the biggest problem is actually a lot more interesting.  And when you solve a big enough problem,  trust me, that becomes your passion,  because people are giving you constant validation  that you're doing something like that.  And that becomes your passion, given it.  So I encourage you guys to think from that lens.  Does anybody else want to share that idea?  I don't mean to be an asshole about it, but.

**[13:10:58]** just to give an example of how to think about it.  And we want to practice.

**[13:11:02]** But it's cool.  No, it's not.

**[13:11:24]** So that's what ideas, and I think that's very important.  The third piece I did want to cover  was what it takes to really be a founder.  I think most people said they want  to start something of their own someday.  And then a few of you said you want  to join a startup, which is a pretty small amount.

**[13:11:30]** As much as I want you guys to build things,  I also wanna say the reality of what it takes  to be your founder.

**[13:11:35]** before I go into what the mindset is to be a founder and what I'd encourage you guys to do.

**[13:11:42]** But guys, obviously you guys know 96 to 98% of startups pay.

**[13:11:52]** The founder journey is probably the hardest journey you're going to go through.  And it's five to seven years of pure chaos in your life.

**[13:12:10]** where you lose friends, you lose a lot of personal relationships  and you spend most of your time just in our office,  frustrated with everybody else around you,  being like you, nobody understands you,  nobody agrees with you.  And I'm all alone in terms of believing  in terms of what I am, what I'm trying to do.

**[13:12:18]** And the first year of a founder's journey is probably the hardest.  Because that's where you're searching the customer you have to sell.

**[13:12:26]** So if you're trying to discover what you want to solve for and try to be the founder  that you want to be.

**[13:12:37]** You spend 30% of your time building, 60% of your time literally finding the customer and 10% of your time iterating your thesis.

**[13:12:47]** The reason I say 60% of the time finding the kashmah,  there's this book that everybody might have heard about.  It's called The Lean Longstripe.

**[13:12:57]** It's basically about how to interact with customers,  building your MVP and stuff like that.  That's the book that came out.  It's written by Steve Blank, who is a pretty famous entrepreneur.

**[13:13:02]** In that book, he really talked about doing all the talking to your customers.

**[13:13:04]** but whatever ideas you guys are looking for

**[13:13:14]** I'd say try to just get one customer and understand how big a problem it is for them and spend time thinking about solving that problem for them.

**[13:13:26]** And before you decide to go on the journey  of being a founder, I really, really level set  on understanding is this something I can spend  the next seven years of my life.

**[13:13:42]** really, really thinking through and reading up a message.  Because most companies, even if after they raise a series A,  series B, series C, they're in the limelight for two weeks.  And then after that, nobody gives a shit what happened  until they raise their next round.

**[13:14:06]** between that journey is where everything is under question  and is where the real hard work happens.  So I'll give you an example.  So for Alope, we raised our seed ground from investors  and we're there to lead the future, which,  and for one week all my friends were really excited  about what we're doing and it was an insane, insane thing.  Insane, like I felt very validated  by what the hell is going on.

**[13:14:09]** and then the next six months, nobody can.

**[13:14:33]** All my friends were making 300 to 400 K, which is any banker,  any engineer at Google is making our money.  I was making maybe $60,000 to $70,000.  And we had one customer that signed the pilot  that decided they don't want to go forward with us.  And we had one office space that we were paying for.

**[13:14:40]** that was increasing that burn way too much  because we put that money in a zoom in  to discuss more with the rest.  And it was just dead of it.

**[13:14:47]** I lost the relationship I was in.  And we were spending 14 hours a day in office,  looking a lot less money than my peers were.

**[13:14:50]** and it was terrible for the next 6 months.

**[13:14:55]** And we finally hit product market before that.

**[13:15:08]** We started scaling, we got an investment,  we got a lending license from Silicon Valley Bank,  partnered with JP Moudang, we started scaling,  and then suddenly Silicon Valley Bank went under.

**[13:15:15]** and silicon valubank collapse are very small and complete collapse.

**[13:15:18]** Everything we started to build for two years in one day was basically non-existent.

**[13:15:26]** And that then the US market was not willing to give us any credit.  Nobody wanted to back us.  We had to close the business down.

**[13:15:29]** that next year proceeding from that.

**[13:16:01]** was when, from being a Stanford grad,  working under Ajay Bangra to raising a fund,  I was basically a nobody where nobody gave a shit  about what I'm doing or what's happening,  and I was genuinely a failure in everything else.  But that's the journey we chose for ourselves,  and that's what being the founder became.  And my co-founder would left that  and he was making 600K when he chose  to be on this journey with us.

**[13:16:10]** He chose to be on his path and he had no money to move out of his apartment and move to a tiny shared apartment with four renders in Brooklyn.

**[13:16:15]** and that's the core crux of what in the founder looks like.

**[13:16:22]** And that's the moment that defines their willingness to be on this journey and actually sustain yourself across that.

**[13:16:43]** And what I actually tell people a lot is, it's okay,  you're not ready for that phase of that journey,  or you're not ready for that.  It's better if you understand that, okay,  maybe financial stability is what I wanna prioritize  slightly more.  I wanna prioritize learning a lot more  and build social credibility for myself a lot more first.

**[13:16:50]** I want to explore building ideas on the side, it's a lot easier to build ideas on the side  and I just want to join a structured environment.

**[13:17:34]** There's nothing wrong with that.  It's probably better to do that for a couple of years.  And then when you're ready, choose to be a founder.  But once you choose to be a founder,  you have to, in your head, agree.  He was seven years.  I might not get any social, like, capital.  I might not get any social validation.  And I might be hated by all my best friends  because they know that I might not see them  during their birthday or during their wedding  or stuff like that.  And that's a sacrifice you have to be very willing to make.  And only then can you choose the idea you choose to work on.  So as long as you're willing to agree with that,  is

**[13:17:47]** the point where I think you should go down the path of being the founder and to the next  piece which I wanted to cover was just what you can do in college to better understand  if you are a founder or not and if it's the right time for you to be a founder or not.

**[13:18:08]** is I think there are four kinds of people.  So there are the Elon Musk's and Sam Altman's of the world.  The very realistic thing is there are very few of them.  If all of us were all of them, then there  would be consistent change in the world  and there'd be 1,000 of them, but all of us can't do that.  But if you have to be the Elon Musk or the Sam Altman.

**[13:18:22]** Understand and reflect, boss, do I really think that contrarian to everybody else around me?  Can I live in social ambiguity for 10 to 15 years of my life?  And do I truly think and keep aware of that level of change?

**[13:18:56]** I generally don't think I'm a Sam Orkman or human mask,  but that's a realization you have to have internally.  Can I do that?  If it's that, then go ahead,  find a problem statement that will really  redefine how everybody views the world next week.  Like, yeah, fucking take everybody to Mars  or literally build, like when Sam Orkman  chose to build OpenAI, for context,  nobody believed in neural networks.  Like, neural networks was considered a dead end,  which is the basis of what OpenAI exists on today, right?

**[13:19:01]** That was a contrarian belief that he spent 10 years of his life on building Upaniyaay  until we all heard about Upaniyaay inside the building.

**[13:19:04]** So that's the first thing the founder.

**[13:19:17]** The second kind of founder is the bucket that I consider myself in, is a VC founder.  He was, I think, I want to build something that will grow at 10 to 50X.

**[13:19:33]** every year. The philosophy is in your first year you should hit 1 million, in your second  year you should hit 10 million, in your third year you should hit 100 million and it is  double double quadruple quadruple is the philosophy 4 step.

**[13:19:44]** companies like Cursor, et cetera have really changed the game  in terms of what a VC funded startup looks like.  And the way a VC model works is if they own 15 to 20%  of your company.

**[13:19:59]** they need to exit at least $500 million plus.  So unless you're going to give them that exit,  they will not invest in it, right?  So that's the second business value  where you have to understand is that.

**[13:20:12]** what you think you can withstand the pressure of,  and be ready for.  And the idea has to be big enough  where the market is north of five, seven billion dollars  to be the chase to justify this sort of return.  Right.

**[13:20:17]** cars 24 people might have heard cars 24 there is a lot of money

**[13:20:21]** the company's ship, the founder might not even exit with.

**[13:20:53]** 20 million dollars after spending 15 million,  15 years building cars for people.  Which is because they did really well,  but now Sikora P-15 doesn't care about them  because they just don't like the model  just doesn't work for them.  Despite having graced and everything you know about them.  So that's the reality of the second bucket  of a VC founded founder journey.  The third bucket is what most of our parents  or parents friends might exist in,  is up.

**[13:21:35]** day-to-day entrepreneur.  It's somebody that builds up profitable business  to make good money.  That's not gonna redefine the world  or grow at 50X or 10X in their first year,  but that's a life that will give you  one to 50 crores, 100 crores a year in net income  and you can live a great life.  In that model, there's no VC.  You own 100% of your business.  You can build a lot of different types  of business use cases there.  You travel in a slow-burn, high-profit  margin business and I think that's the type  of businesses that can deal in scale-up,  especially with AI trade.

**[13:21:50]** And a lot of people are making a lot of money  and yield is killing people.  That's the third type of founder.  That doesn't care as much about the limelight,  cares about living a good life,  and wants to own 100% of what they do,  and is okay with going slow,  making good amounts of money and living a good life.

**[13:21:54]** and the fourth type of question  is somebody that doesn't try even for us.

**[13:22:03]** Like, they like structure, they like when people tell them what used to be done and they excel at structure.

**[13:22:10]** Those type of people will always excel in being the top three members at companies.

**[13:22:25]** Those are the people that go to McKinsey,  those are the people that lead growth  at series B, series C companies.  Those are the people that thrive  when they have a structure set in place  and can do exceptionally well at it.

**[13:22:37]** And it's very important at this stage  for you guys to think about  which of these four buckets you line  and choose then which problem statement  or what experiences you gather  to try to fit into this one.

**[13:22:46]** And the final thing that I will say in terms of what I would do if I was in your shoes on campus.

**[13:22:55]** You guys are at the biggest inflection which is like not the internet, it's bigger than the internet.  AI is like humans invention of fire.

**[13:23:25]** The reason why it's that big  is if you've heard Jensen Huang speak  or the founder of Entropics speak,  what we constitute as intelligence  is being generalized, is what they call AGI.  So if I thought solving problem statements,  getting good grades in a homework assignment  or an exam, or thinking through problem statements  is my talent, well that talent  is increasingly getting generalized.

**[13:23:34]** Sam Altman printed it yesterday about how he was building an app on Codex, and Codex  was able to think about more different scenarios than he could.

**[13:23:38]** humanly even think about, it was way better than ever doing that task.

**[13:23:52]** And in the next eight months, we'll already  be at a standpoint where a lot of intelligence  that we think we count ourselves as intelligent ads  is going to be generally ads.

**[13:24:12]** So at that point, it's very important for you guys  to think about what skillset are you guys building,  if that's the workforce you're going to be competing against  and those of the agents are going to be evaluated against  in terms of who I hire, somebody or who I building,  agent that's developing all of this in general.

**[13:24:20]** The first thing that I'm going to experiment with you guys is, I'll ask a simple question.  How many of you use cloud or chat GTP every day?

**[13:24:29]** And what do you guys use?  How many of you use it to complete your homework assignments every day?

**[13:24:31]** Thank you very much.

**[13:24:35]** How many of you guys use it to ask random questions about?

**[13:24:44]** what should I do, if I have this problem or like learn something etc.  How many of you use it to build something every day?

**[13:25:01]** Okay, so what people generally tend to ask chat GPP is Monday in question and they try to build outside GPP.  What I recommend you guys to go on chat GPP or cloud, ask it is

**[13:25:06]** What do the top 1 percentile of users use you for?

**[13:25:11]** and you'll see every month that questions answer will change.

**[13:25:17]** the top 1 percentile of users of chat gtd use chat gtd to bring

**[13:25:24]** to extend their horizons of what they have to do,  so to question themselves,  so you can dig deeper into your pieces.

**[13:25:28]** and do think about what's next.

**[13:25:37]** But I'd recommend you guys to do it, there are five apps, I'd recommend you guys all to definitely play around with these.  Lovable?

**[13:25:40]** Link.  Imagine.

**[13:25:45]** claw, open press and open claw, these five apps.

**[13:25:51]** If you guys can use these five apps and build just random things at least in the day.

**[13:25:58]** you guys will be the most valuable asset to any company that you choose to join or any company you choose to start yourself.

**[13:26:08]** The biggest problem statement every company,  from a mid-sized company to a large enterprise,  is trying to solve for,  and that's why the company universities like yours,  too high.

**[13:26:11]** Dead?

**[13:26:15]** talent where employees have no idea how they are going to use that.

**[13:26:21]** If you look at the use case at even companies like Gain, the way AI is being used.

**[13:26:33]** and Australia that they will suit actually for this kind of streaming company.  What they said was, bro, these are the problem statements my customer is coming for,  create a presentation and send it.

**[13:26:37]** That's the extent to charge GPD usage at all of these companies.

**[13:26:51]** And that's a problem statement for them  because we are using chat GPT for something  that was capable of doing two years ago.  There's no evolution of the use case of chat GPT  to actually drive any business in there.

**[13:26:54]** And what we are looking for from college students is...

**[13:27:10]** somebody who is extremely talented either cursor or open-clutch at GBB to rethink some use case  they are trying to create in turn and this individualizes a drastically different way to think about implementing.

**[13:27:22]** And that's what each of them is optimizing.  If you look at any job posting that any company  for an engineer or a growth engineer or anybody is able to do.

**[13:27:28]** There are a couple of new tools they ask you to be comfortable with.  So that could be easy.

**[13:27:31]** That could be cost, sir. I could be in the news.

**[13:27:38]** So I recommend every day trying to use one of these tools to maximize your data.

**[13:28:03]** The second piece is we don't know coding, which I think some of you might not.  That's an irrelevant requirement from any company moving forward.  It's obviously good to be able to know how to code.  But if within your skill set you're able to just make use of cloud code or cursor,  it's good enough and you have to know no code included.

**[13:28:10]** And the third thing I'd recommend is when you guys are doing interviews or when you guys are thinking about building something.

**[13:28:30]** Rather than saying, did I work with this company and I helped them get 300 leads or I did them, they XYZ for them.  If you show any company what project you built using AI and you show them exactly what that was,  any company will be 10x more likely to either hire you or...

**[13:28:36]** give you money to basically solve that problem for them or start the company you're on.

**[13:28:39]** So that's what I'd focus on if I was in your shoes.

**[13:28:55]** And the last thing I just said here  is to test if you're set to be an entrepreneur,  is most VCs are very good at pattern matching.  They have no idea what every industry does.  But what they just look for is patterns.

**[13:29:02]** How confident are you in what you're building?  Does the pattern align with the 10 companies  that I've seen success with?

**[13:29:11]** and the biggest pattern they look for  is to what extent is this guy going to go  to basically make whatever they're doing a success.

**[13:29:26]** So the one thing that I've seen most founders during the time  in college, what they were just insane at  was they got what they wanted to do  by just saying yes to everything.

**[13:29:33]** So I'll give you an example of this friend of mine that just sold his company for $150,000.

**[13:29:38]** The founder of Slack, Stewart Butterfield, was visiting campus.

**[13:29:41]** and he brings that in to the conference.

**[13:29:46]** But at that time he was speaking an idea and he really wanted to mix two buttercream with mango.

**[13:29:54]** So even in getting the event, he snuck back into the parking lot where the cars come to pick him up.

**[13:30:17]** And when Stuart Butterfield was going in to his car,  he just stopped Stuart Butterfield there  and interacted with him.  And today's Stuart Butterfield was an advisor  and investor in his company and his mentor.  And that was a big relationship that helped him  decide what he needs to build  and hire the talent he needs to build  just from that 60 second gap.

**[13:30:22]** And in college I think a lot of people try to tell you go, homework assignment, exam, XYZ.

**[13:30:38]** But sync, yes, I think is the biggest framework  that is really, really important for you to build  and experiment with to see how much you can say yes to  and make happen to yourself.  So that's the last thing that I just wanted to say.  Thank you guys.

**[13:30:44]** Thank you.  Thank you.

**[13:30:46]** Thank you very much.

**[13:31:13]** Yes, ma'am.

**[13:31:25]** Thank you very much.

**[13:31:36]** So, yeah, that's a great question.

**[13:31:38]** Most air startups.

**[13:31:41]** Go after a train.

**[13:31:51]** So there is an idea that just, for example, was that was the first use case that chatGPD  had, and they built against that, chatGPD became connected to that.

**[13:32:09]** Similarly, a lot of companies, the most common AI companies, will see the new model that comes out  and try to create the most obvious use case that is a result of the model that you and I would also agree with  is a use case that this could be used for.

**[13:32:15]** So, a lot of companies went into image generation, the second they saw give me first place.

**[13:32:25]** a lot of companies went into task management  because they're like, oh, I can organize your calendar,  or I can summarize your meeting notes.

**[13:32:39]** If you look at SaaS companies when the internet was born,  there were a lot of similar companies that came out  that made note-taking apps, like not the auto note-taking,  but like notes, like dots, words.

**[13:32:41]** There were a lot of companies that tried to build browsers.

**[13:33:03]** There were a lot of companies that tried to build  website templates, stuff like that.  But if you realize, the most common notes app  is Docs and Microsoft Word, because they were incumbents,  that was obviously the most obvious application.  They provided us free of cost,  and nobody else could complete the notes.

**[13:33:15]** browser. The most common browser is Safari, Microsoft. The two biggest incumbents own  this space. Who uses Mozilla anymore? Nobody. Right? So...

**[13:33:24]** It's nice to think that the most obvious use case  that comes out of AI is something  that a SAM argument is not already thought of.

**[13:33:30]** The only hundreds as companies have come out that have done really well are things like  SAP.

**[13:33:32]** I think it's like audio good.

**[13:33:48]** are things like sales points.  There were problem statements.  A Microsoft didn't want to solve.  It's too niche, it's too technical,  it's not large enough in itself for them to go out  and expand and spend so many resources to try and solve.

**[13:34:00]** and OpenAI will eat you up.  People thought agentic browsing will be massive,  perplexity longstays, OpenAI longstays,  it's too obvious.  They have to build this to build distribution.

**[13:34:10]** the AI startups that are doing something that an open AI can't think about  because it's too either hard a problem and too malicious space for them to solve.

**[13:34:13]** For example, some of the biggest companies is a company called Trava.

**[13:34:18]** they solve a problem for construction labor.

**[13:34:26]** That's a $75 billion market in years.  Now, they just solve one niche use case for that,  hyper-focused killer.

**[13:34:40]** When there's a company, my thing started, it's basically wanted to build an AI accept  for investment analysis funds.  It's called HEDIA.

**[13:34:44]** There is our 125 million dollars.

**[13:34:47]** they did very well.

**[13:34:55]** In the last two weeks, Claude launched Excel within,  like Claude within Excel,  that fully automates investment pieces.

**[13:35:01]** and open eyes integrating with exactly those companies that's replacing these issues.

**[13:35:13]** So, all these fancy use cases that everybody thinks are really cool are the ones where AI  companies might be able to raise money that gets stuck or get eaten up by the incumbents  itself.

**[13:35:36]** The companies that are doing non-opolis use cases,  or secondly, which is your biggest advantage,  are rethinking how that problem can be solved.  So like, ground up, rethinking kibos.  Like, Lovable didn't try to make a Shopify  or try to plug in an app,  within an app builder ecosystem,  how you think about that.  We say, dude, app building should just be done  by talking to an AI.

**[13:35:38]** And that's a use case that's just absurd.

**[13:35:47]** And now they have so much more distribution  that their most likely outcome is  even if a child gives it out,  they'll have to buy a lot of it out  because it's too good now.

**[13:35:51]** and chargeable you could not solve it and that was okay.  That could be.

**[13:35:58]** Thank you.

**[13:36:33]** Yeah, so actually, Upaniya was solving more than one paper.  Sam Altman's...

**[13:36:40]** Realization was that the success of every company is determined by the team.

**[13:36:44]** Why is everybody so dependent on hiring the best talent?

**[13:36:53]** What if I can solve the biggest problem which is,  I just have so, such few smart people  to solve the biggest problem in the world.

**[13:36:56]** That was literally the problem statement we went up.

**[13:37:04]** And that is probably the most ambitious problem  to go after being like, bro, the labor market is  the biggest problem I want to complete.

**[13:37:06]** and that was his thought process.

**[13:37:17]** So everybody is trying to solve a problem,  the way they articulate that is different.  And the biggest thing is when a startup starts,

**[13:37:35]** The first problem statement they probably solve for is a lot more mundane and the problem  statement they end up solving.  Like Google's problem statement was good.  I want to, like people are trying to search the web, Yahoo made the yellow pages digital.  I want to make the yellow pages searchable.

**[13:37:38]** And that's what this study offers.

**[13:37:46]** And if they had thought about that idea one year later,  Google would not have existed, because the internet would  have been too big for them to index.

**[13:37:50]** So it was the right time and the right version of that same problem.

**[13:38:18]** So, uh...

**[13:38:29]** digital marketing in general, that's the one space that has a lot of tools in terms of automation  with image generation, social media analytics, social media posting and stuff like that.

**[13:39:36]** So, I think the biggest use case that everybody's tackling  right now is how to generate more and more ads  that are more and more personalized.  So what they're calling it is generative experiences.  And that's the next main basis for, I think,  how marketing and experience is going to be.  So, I would recommend for you to spend more time  experimenting with those use cases  where that's the biggest problem statement  companies are trying to solve for.  And there's new notion of a genetic shocker  where from selling to humans,  we're going to be selling to machines.  So, there's a lot of research being done in this space  and there's a lot of interesting insights there.  So I would spend more time reading up about that  and rather than trying to learn out of code,  try to make the most of some of these platforms  that exist, like Varun Maya in India.  He's an absolute piece in doing digital marketing  just using AI.  And he's not technically savvy,  he's trained himself to be technically savvy,  but I'd follow him and he hasn't seen anything like that.

**[13:39:38]** But I'm not

**[13:40:48]** I think there are a lot of problem statements  that are important to solve.  There's an interesting article at YC Road,  which I would recommend you all to read.  It's a short article.  It literally is YC's call for the companies  they want you to build.  They've highlighted seven ideas that they think  are the most important ideas,  that today you should be building to apply to YC.  I think that's a very good framework  for the seven largest things that need to be solved for.  One of them happens to be  what we're building AI for agencies,  but there are seven core problem statements  they've highlighted that they think  has the biggest disruption with AI.  And I would say across the board,  everybody thinks that those seven use cases  would be the biggest disruptions that could exist.  I would look at those seven problem statements  and then find a sub-problem within that  that you think resonates with you the most,  and that's probably the best way to go about it.

**[13:40:56]** Sorry, but the reason why they did this was because they had so many YC applications  where everybody was just trying to follow the trend.

**[13:41:14]** because they saw enough image making apps,  they saw enough companies that had no differentiator  or no, what they call long term mode,  which is like what enables you to survive  if somebody that raised $100 million  or has $100 million chooses to start tackling  your problems.

**[13:41:18]** So that's why they did this, just to make younger founders.

**[13:41:22]** get more direction in terms of what problems they should be thinking about.

**[13:41:51]** Yeah, that's the artist one, man.  But that's the real one.  So the reason why I said the biggest thing about a business  as a founder is not building the product,  it's actually doing the customer.

**[13:42:08]** Like, one of my first hires was somebody that just failed at his start-up.  And he thought he failed at his start-up because he didn't build a good enough product.  But then I made his job in our early phase for six months just to try to find one customer.

**[13:42:14]** And in the first six months of his job, he was able to even close one customer.

**[13:42:22]** and I think that's actually the hardest problem to solve.  If you can get one person to pay you.

**[13:43:15]** Don't drop out, don't try to raise this money.  No VC cares about your ideas until you have some inclination  of what somebody will be willing to pay for it.  I would just say don't try to find one customer for yourself.  And a lot of us, I know if you have a note-taking app  or something like that, maybe you should find slightly  higher number of customers.  If you're running a B2B business, one customer  is a good enough signal that you can solve for it.  But I would spend all my time doing that.  You just validate it.  If you have a customer and you're giving money for it,  I'm good enough to start doing this.  Once you have that one customer, depending  on how much capital you require, either use that money  or start scaling up and try to find  the exact same customer like that customer.  Or you go out and raise money and try  to find 100 like them in the next few months.

**[13:43:18]** If it seems too broad, you can ask me at,  I don't know what your instance is, but I could give you.

**[13:44:06]** Yeah, so BDC marketing is probably the hardest because,  so the way people do the math is, for example,  you wanna add $100 million in revenue.  People say, what's your average contract value?  So for example, for us, an average contract value  is about 100 in, let's assume 100,000 dollars a year.  So I need 1,000 customers to add 100 million a year.  So then I backtrack,  and boss, if I only need 1,000 customers,  I...

**[13:44:43]** How am I going to get these customers?  What are the different channels I need to use?  And how much time do I need to take?  How many sales are going to hire to hit them?  Now, for a B2C business, suppose you  charge a subscription cost of $10 a month.  That's $120 a year.  Let's assume $100 a year.  You need 100,000 customers to wait 100 million AR.  So that's where it gets very, very hard to have 100,000  customers to do.

**[13:44:51]** The main channels that people are using to build and get customers today.  First is you are the biggest brand that your own company will ever have.  So if you see there is LinkedIn is like full of founders building in public.  Similarly Twitter.

**[13:44:53]** Twitter is a massive place to get customers.

**[13:45:02]** That is a slow burn process, but that will take you six,  seven months to start getting even two to three customers  to start signing up your product.

**[13:45:19]** The third biggest space is YC hack and use.  They have forum, you don't have to be part of YC  to be part of the forum.  Engage in that forum, see the, it's like Reddit,  see the sub threads where people are trying  to experiment with ideas.  Post your idea there.

**[13:45:23]** Robinhood launched just on hacker news. They had 10,000 customers in one day

**[13:45:37]** So, that was their only growth over,  they had no growth over the program.  So, by C Hackenews and Reddit,  our two channels that are great  to try to get super technical,  people that will give you a lot of feedback.

**[13:45:53]** The fifth channel that people use a lot is product hunt.  It launches a product.  It's free of charge.  Get a couple of images out.  Take a video of yourself launching a product on Loom  and just launch it.  That's the fifth channel that people use.  And the sixth is...

**[13:46:07]** Legally, you are close to friends.  Like, you have your first 100 friends sign up  in universities if that's your outbound,  and then go to our universities,  have your friends just evangelize for you.  That's the most common way that people use.

**[13:46:09]** Thank you.

**[13:47:01]** Hackathons are probably the best place  to both validate your idea, get some money,  and also just really build up your resume.  Like any person that's hiring or any VC that's looking  is trying to understand how many times  you formally try to put yourself out there  to push an idea, right?  And then how successful you were at it as a result of it.  That's all they look at.  I did maybe more than 20 hackathons,  like Stanford has three hacks,  I went to London to fly out for hackathon.  It was the best experience for me personally.  That's why we obviously just partnered with Microsoft,  but we also just, I thought this was very, very exciting.

**[13:47:03]** I would say even if you don't have an idea,  even if you just, this is the last thing.

**[13:47:05]** This is the last day.

**[13:47:26]** Okay, bye, it's not that hard to build something.  Even if the submission is something  you can quickly master up, go on, loveable,  go on any of these platforms,  put 10 problem statements, have Opus 4.6,  generate whatever the first demo you can for yourself  and submit.

**[13:48:03]** 100K is a massive sum of money, especially in India,  to get the ball rolling, to do anything you want.  Then finally, your first 1,000 customers, bro,  you spend $100 acquiring each customer, it's fine.  Do that, get your first 1,000 customers, get validity.  Easy.  Money is probably the easiest solution to everything.  So I would highly recommend.  Try it out, it's a lot easier to build it out.  Even if you have one exam you do slightly worse on,  you probably already have your placements figured out,  build it out, I would highly, highly recommend it.  And definitely put it on your resume if you haven't already.

**[13:48:08]** but it's not too much then.

**[13:48:17]** Thank you very much.

**[13:48:29]** That's just one second, I'm going to take you out on the plane.

**[13:48:35]** Thank you.  Thank you.
