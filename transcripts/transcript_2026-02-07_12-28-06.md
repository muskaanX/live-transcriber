**[12:22:28]** Hi, so this is a test run for the product to see if it's working.

**[12:22:37]** And so far it is working with voice isolation on system level.

**[12:22:52]** You know it can oh my god. I have a very banger transfer from yesterday with

**[12:22:54]** Is my mobile working?

**[12:22:59]** I'm not sure which one is better.

**[12:23:28]** So I just want to be sure that it can pick up any mic sounds. Can we do a mic test with the transcriber?  Okay. Oh, by the way

**[12:23:33]** Isolation is working.

**[12:23:37]** Please get up and do the test.

**[12:24:29]** We can only test it finally when there is silence and the mic is being used.  That is the final test.  The mic is working now. Thank you very much.  I'm moving it this way.  I disconnected it.  No, no. I think the thing is we need pin drop silence otherwise.  Does it sit like this way?  There isn't one. It's being used.  I don't think that's anything to do with it.  I need a spoiler. That's fine.  Closer to me?  Closer to him. He's going to sit here.  He's going to sit here.  Looking at the screen, right?  No.  So where's the screen here? I put the screen there for a while.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So what do I need?  The speaker needs to be close to this microphone. That's it.  So it can be there.

**[12:24:34]** Transcription for him  Yeah

**[12:24:39]** Okay, wait, we need the secret for the man.  We can't force him.  Yeah, for the secret.

**[12:24:42]** Can you read from this screen?

**[12:24:46]** I cannot give him my assistance.

**[12:24:53]** I am the one operating it if there's any issues.

**[12:24:56]** Where does this go?

**[12:25:12]** Move the chair away from me. You be close to the speaker.  There is a thing, you see, I have an hip injury. I can't move like this. I will need some assistance.  The way I have been asked to shift, I can't shift that easily.  Do you need a lot of help?

**[12:25:16]** Yes. My GPU is being used.

**[12:25:21]** Make sure my wire doesn't snap.

**[12:25:27]** What I'm trying to do is get this microphone to raise the speaker over there.

**[12:25:33]** Yeah, where does the speaker need to be? Decide that first.

**[12:25:42]** I can sit here still, right? The speaker is here.  She does not mind being here. The speaker is here.  I have no issues with her.

**[12:26:14]** My test test one, one, two, two, one, two, two, hi system testing with the mic.

**[12:26:41]** Rish, can you speak into the microphone? I need to see the decibels.  What do you think will be the average voice for him?  I think this is going to be the average voice for him.

**[12:26:54]** You have to be thinking like this.

**[12:27:00]** Yep, it's working.  Perfect.  Okay.
